# Pseudo-Quadrature-Mirror-Filter

Implementation of the PQMF (Pseudo Quadrature Mirror Filter) filter, used for decomposition and reconstruction of signals into subbands, focusing on digital audio and machine learning applications. Includes versions optimized for real-time processing, as well as TorchScript and Pure Data-compatible wrappers, allowing direct integration into interactive and experimental workflows. The code is inspired by ([acids-ircam's RAVE models](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE)), with some adaptations.
